*Warning*: This package is still at an alpha stage of development. The API may still be subject to changes, and the library has not yet received much feedback from users. 

## Quickstart

This package is used to easily load a sensible subset of variables from [fMRIprep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) bold confounds in a python environment. If `file="my_fmri.nii.gz"` is a nifti file generated by fMRIprep, you can parse the companion tsv confounds like that:
```python
confounds = load_confounds.Params36().load(file)
```
and then simply plug the confounds into a [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/) `masker`:
```python
img = masker.transform(file, confounds=confounds)
```

## Installation

In order to use `load_confounds` it needs to be installed as a python environment (Python >=3.5) using:
```bash
pip install load_confounds
```
This module can then be imported:
```python
import load_confounds as lc
```

## Predefined strategies
It is first possible to import confounds with some predefined preprocessing strategy. Here we use the `Params6` strategy:
```python
conf = lc.Params6()
confounds = conf.load('path/to/file/sub-01_ses-001.tsv')
```

The predefined strategies are all adapted from Ciric et al. 2017, and currently include:
 * `Params2` : Mean white matter and CSF signals, with high-pass filter.
 * `Params6` : Basic motion parameters with high pass filter.
 * `Params9` : Basic motion parameters, WM/CSF signals, global signal and high pass filter.
 * `Params24` : Full motion parameters (derivatives, squares and squared derivatives), with high pass filter.
 * `Params36` : Motion parameters, WM/CSF signals, global signal, high pass filter. All noise components are fully expanded (derivatives, squares and squared derivatives).
 * `AnatCompCor` : Motion parameters (fully expanded), high pass filter, and acompcor.
 * `TempCompCor` : High pass filter, and tcompcor.

## Flexible denoising strategy
It is also possible to fine-tune a subset of noise variables, and the type of these variables:
```python
conf = lc.Confounds(strategy=['high_pass', 'motion', 'global'], motion="derivatives")
confounds = conf.load('path/to/file/sub-01_ses-001.tsv', )
```

Currently the following noise categories are supported:
* `motion` the motion parameters including 6 translation/rotation, and optionally derivatives, squares, and squared derivatives. Motion parameters can also be reduced through a PCA. Default: no PCA, and 24 motion model.
* `high_pass` basis of discrete cosines covering slow time drift frequency band.
* `wm_csf` the average signal of white matter and cerebrospinal fluid masks, and optionally derivatives, squares, and squared derivatives. Default: simple average, without squares or derivatives.
* `compcor` the results of a PCA applied on a mask based on either anatomy, temporal variance, or both. The number of components can be adjusted. Default: anat compcor with 6 components.
* ` global`  the global signal, and optionally derivatives, squares, and squared derivatives. Default: simple average without squares or derivatives.

See the docstring of `load_confounds.Confounds` for a list of available tweaking parameters.

## Nifti files and file collections
Note that if a `.nii.gz` file is specified, `load_confounds` will automatically look for the companion `tsv`confound file generated by fMRIprep. A panda DataFrame can also be entered instead of a file name. It is also possible to specify a list of confound (or imaging) files, in which case `load_confounds` will return a list of pandas DataFrames.

## A note on demeaning confounds
Unless you use the `detrend` or `high_pass` options of Nilearn maskers, it may be important to de-mean the confounds. This is done by default, and is required to properly regress out confounds with the `standardize=False`, `standardize=True` or `standardize="zscore"` options of nilearn maskers. If you want to use `standardize="psc"`, you will need to turn off the demeaning in `load_confounds`, which can be achieved using, e.g.:
```python
conf = lc.Params6(demean=False)
```
